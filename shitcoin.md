## General themes for all the below
* Creating and managing tokens
* Voting and governance tools
* Identity oracles
* Regulation compliance
* Contracting UI

# ETH
Decentralized contracts, proof of stake
Summary of ERC: https://eips.ethereum.org/erc

# Tether
Bitcoin bank keeping 1T to 1USD value backed by cash, and cash equivalents like loans (not clear what requirements are)
Stablecoin useful to trade between exchanges but seems like there's serious issues on how much of their reserves they keep, the audit seems sketchy 
Argument for bitcoin bubble is that Bitcoin price is BTC/Tether not BTC/USD and given that Tether gets minted without reserves this would explain the bubble    

# Cardano
Ethereum founders split and made their own contract platforms: Cardano and Polkadot
Main difference with Ethereum is approaching public companies before private companies
Key to this is an identity solution (I guess so you can have real world consequences for fraud)
Ouroboros proof of stake concensus algorithm
Hydra second layer to enable massive scaling of smart contracts even on non main tokens
Can stake to get percentage based rewards (about 70% of tokens staked)
Has about 7% inflation every year and involved premine where cardano foundation has about 5M tokens
ETH inflation is about 4% every year

# Binance Coin
Also has Defi - usage increased because of high Ethereum transaction fees
Binance lets users pay for fees on their exchange with binance coin

# USD coin
Stablecoin supported by Coinbase, Bitmain and circle for exchanges - also used by Visa

# Chainlink 
Decentralized contracts - has nice usage instructions in the browser https://docs.chain.link/docs/beginners-tutorial/
Check them out a bit more

# Litecoin/Bitcoin Cash/Bitcoin SV
One of the many straight Bitcoin forks - minor tweaks to improve scaling at the cost of changing base protocol

# Polkadot
Rust based decentralized contracts with staking, decentralized contracts and parapps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDqkzvA4C0E&ab_channel=Polkadot

# Internet Computer
Tutorials here: https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/explore-templates.html
Decentralized cloud alternative
Funny that market cap is so high considering project doesn't have that many Github stars https://github.com/dfinity/ic

# XRP 
Settlement layer between banks. Got sued by SEC for selling their tokens as unregistered securities


# Uniswap
Python SDK: https://github.com/uniswap-python/uniswap-python
Trade cryptocurrencies on Ethereum in a decentralized exchange
