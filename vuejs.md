# Things I learnt coding Vue.js

Uses reactive components
Vuejs 2.0 has scrimba tutorials which are interactive version of twitch
Can use the JS console to change the state of variable for easy debugging and demoing
Are apps basically components? (nope there are components)
Can trigger functions using `v-on:click` or `v-if` etc..
Components automatically become JS tags and can accept props (inputs) and a template to render
Main app can also accept a name for the app and associated data in a json format
Vue components modeled after web componenets
Uses mustache for template language
Vue instance has a callback mechanism where behavior can be triggered on componenent, load, death etc..
`v-bind` lets you do toggles
kebab-case lmao - everything the same size
Apps can load specific compoenents
Props can be arbitrary data structures
Data flows go from parent to child
SIngle file components .vue which includes both css, js and html
State management like Flux
